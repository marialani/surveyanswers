  "That until the pandemic it feels like the NHS ran on a reactive basis. The massive change needs to be that their ethos & business plan needs to start with a proactive ethos from public health. Do do more FaceTime appointments. Do fine people for not attending appointments. Do completely change their staffing structure to take on more workers so that their shift times decrease to 8-10 hr max shift & pay/hr increases. Make them feel valued & ensure their work life balance & wellbeing is addressed. Sort out hospital parking, it‚Äôs an issue everywhere, build multi storey car parks underground if need be & make the first two hours of parking FREE everywhere to all so that people can visit their loved ones.",
  "It has shown us there are more efficient and fairer ways of doing things. A few examples:\n - Universities should teach remotely and degrees should take no more than two years. Costs will tumble. More people can study. Campuses can be repurposed (housing?). Society will become more equal as bright kids from poor areas will couple off with locals instead of others at university, and as non-university towns are no longer denuded of their most able young people\n- Schools should no longer have long summer holidays. They were introduced when schooling became compulsory, as kids were needed to get the crops in. Now, they promote inequality as bright kids from disadvantaged backgrounds fall behind during the long breaks. Ending them would drive up educational attainment for all, too\n - MPs and Lords should debate mostly virtually, over Zoom. This would anchor them more in their constituencies, aligning them more closely with voters' interests and keeping them out of the clutches of lobbyists. The Palace of Westminster should become a hotel, so we'd get a return on the refurb costs, and the administrative capital of the country and some limited meeting facilities for parliamentarians should be provided somewhere closer to the middle of the country (Manchester or Halifax, where a Louvre-style roof could be put on the Peace Hall)",

  "It‚Äôs definitely made me realised how unhappy I have been working in an office environment - whilst I miss the social interaction , the commute and the distractions of being around others in open plan , made the day quite stressful and not as productive. This triggered my move back to Cornwall from London, where I am now able to work remotely and have a better work/ life balance near my friends and family . \nIt also made me feel strongly that minimum wage workers and those classed as ‚Äúnon skilled‚Äù need more workers rights and fairer pay . Generally , I feel like this has very clearly exposed the inequalities between classes , race - the differences of how we live during COVID has also been dependent on our socioeconomic backgrounds and those with hard lives have felt it even harder\nI feel extremely privileged to be in the position where I have a nice home, can still work and earn and not worry about my job security - but also feel the intense unfairness of it and have learnt to sit in that discomfort and try to learn what I can do to make things better for others",
  "On the one hand there seems to be a shocking lack of decency amongst some folk who blatantly flout rules & behave badly towards others trying to carry out essential jobs & services, to the point of risking people's lives, & on the other hand an overwhelming number of people who are totally selfless & will always put others first & go the extra mile. Clearly partly this is down to human spirit & a crisis bringing out either the best or the worst in people. However we need to find a way to both harness this best of spirit in people & engender a much improved set of behaviours, responsibilities & basic human kindness amongst others. I think this is something tackled at grass roots level, in the home, during schooling etc but we could I'm sure make great use of social media as a way of positively influencing. For me, as a very limited social media user, in the past I have felt this has too many negatives amongst younger people, cyber bullying etc & my change of mind is around using it globally as a way to positively influence & bring more disparate groups together.",
  "I feel the UK response to COVID-19 demonstrates that we need more devolution and less centralisation. Areas like Scotland / Wales and Northern Ireland have actually reacted reasonably effectively to this crisis, regional parliaments in England might have had the same effect. \nI also have concerns about how the UK as a whole did not seem to learn from what was going on around it. Ireland for example passed crisis laws that meant individuals could not travel outside of a certain distance from their homes. This actually helped the police to police the pandemic so it did not become a battle of interpretation.\nWorking from home is another area that I think has been demonstrated to work, this could be something the government could take forward. It means less traffic and less CO2 emissions. It is clear now we have the technology to work from home were possible. This could mean focusing on better broadband in the UK instead of spending billions on a bridge to Northern Ireland, HS2 or other prestige projects that may be outdated by the time they are completed.",
  "I've learnt that time to myself and time doing things I enjoy is important, especially in regards to mental health. Having more time due to not having to go to work (due to being furloughed ) has made me happier and more relaxed. I still miss working but more time is nice\nI've learned that looking after your health and mental health is very important. It helps me to understand sd nd and deal with the uncertainty better when I have done some meditation or yoga or deep breathing.\nTechnology is amazing. I am very grateful that I can call and video call loved ones easily. And stay in touch via social media too.\nCommunity and caring for one another is important. It's been lovely seeing the rainbows around encouringing people. And seeing neighbours talking more.\nI hope this continues.\nThe NHS is super important and I am super grateful for it and all the key workers too.\nI have seen that less traffic on the roads has improved air quality and noise. It had been do much quieter. It's been nice seeing wild flowers pop up around too on verges, paths ect.",
  'It is clear that , as a country, we are not able to deal with some issues in a pandemic. In particular, we need to develop more national and local resilience and ability to manufacture and supply essential items from within the country. The current economic position of letting the market decide has been shown to be fatally flawed, hence we have been unable to provide sufficient quantities of PPE quickly enough as all countries were chasing the same markets. The last pandemic testing two years ago should have made that clear but the lessons were not learned because we were still thinking in terms of austerity. The amount we have now had to spend is far in excess of any savings made. Clearly 14 years of austerity left our NHS vulnerable. It is crazy that in such a wealthy country our mantra was "Save the NHS" - had it been properly funded it could and should have been in a better position to "Save Us".\nWe still are a nation of reasonable people who will follow guidance and rules of they are properly explained. We have been spoken down to far too much.',
  "Hello, bizarrely, from a work / life balance I have really enjoyed this pandemic. I have enjoyed not dragging myself out of bed, driving myself to work, walking down the road from the car park and sitting in a small cramped office in close proximity to people I don‚Äôt particularly like. Working from home has seen my concentration improve massively as I am not constantly interrupted by annoying people or nice people who just want to have a natter. I am actually more productive. I have really enjoyed spending more time with my family, I have a much better ‚Äòoffice‚Äô at home. At work I have a view of a brick wall and, due to my closeness to the toilets, I am prone to hearing the occasional ‚Äòplinky plonk üò©. At home, I have a view out to the garden. The sun floods in in the morning and you can hear the birds tweeting. Bliss! I have often wondered if I could work from home. With improvements in technology (Microsoft Teams) this has been far easier than I would have imagined. I am really enjoying life at a lower pace.I don‚Äôt want to go back to the office!",
  "Yes, issues around hygiene, personal space, and traffic free streets and spaces. \nI now value contact with friends and colleagues a bit more; I‚Äôm making more effort to keep in touch online and enjoying video chatting in ways i never thought of - texts and calls were the rule before. And now I assume I should have video to see friends. \nI value peace and quiet far more and traffic free streets without cars all over the pavements every day outside my door [commuters!] and tailbacks on all the roads. It‚Äôs been so much safer to cycle now. Pollution is so much less intrusive - air so much clearer. I value open spaces and my garden more than it did - and feel sorry for people in crumpled small flats with no space of their own - I've seen young people in meetings where they are all on their own beds to attend in private. I am more sceptical of ‚Äòtiny homes‚Äô as a housing solution. I want to get rid of traffic and make space for walking safely and cycling safely now traffic is speeding up again.",
  "The power of community and kindness, common sense and responsibility of the vast majority of people - yet the media often portrays a different, sensationalist view focussing on the negative. \nThe importance of having walkable, local community service centres ie village centre with shops, services and green space Not dominated by traffic.\nThe need to change our transport system with more cycling and walking. Our focus must be more local in all ways, including shopping and services. Back to seasonal food - no flown in strawberries in December. \nWe should have an environmental, biodiversity Legislative, auditing and taxation system as we do financial Auditing, focusing on every decision and activity in government and private sector to prioritise, incentivise and change our processes and activities to create a sustainable world. Eg why are we still using polystyrene in packaging, is ppe biodegradable, non oil based, etc\nThe value of quiet. \nThe importance of inter-generational mixin.",
  'I would love for more employers to embrace flexible working hours. Some people are naturally morning people, some night owls. Some people work best from home (a comfortable familiar environment with few disturbances) others need to go to an office (to be social or to be around colleagues). Most work best with a combination. \nI have always been a morning person myself but still have to sit through late meetings and get into work for 9am (even though I prefer to start at 7am and end early). I know some night owls struggle too - the other way around. \nEmployees have proven they can be just as productive/effective working from home during this crisis - some even more productive working from home. It is possible to make meetings more efficient when they are online. Online meetings need to be a new norm too. \nI really hope working from home and prioritising both work and family life will be a new "normal" after this. It is good for both employers, organisations and the employees.',
  "I am far more interested in politics, government and leadership. I am appalled by the failure of our political leaders to speak truthfully, and their failure to lead in way that the population can trust and follow. Far too many example of do as I say, not as I do. And blatant misinformation throughout this crisis, on PPE, use of masks, testing, care homes, etc. \nI have also realised far more than ever before the extent to which this country is held largely held together by people in predominantly low paid professions, and the impact on increasing poverty and inequality in this country over the many years of austerity.\nAnd as a final point, this crisis has highlighted the bubble world that are leading politicians, claiming to act on behalf of the people yet seemingly deaf to their views. And why in times of extreme crisis isn't there more cross-party work to do whats right fro the country, not one political party?",
  "Yes. I have changed my mind about how I want to live my life. \nAs a Portuguese Millennial hit by the financial crisis in 2008 I felt the need to go abroad and try for a more stable life, today with Coronavirus I feel that if companies choose to let people work from home I can return to my home country and have the stability that I have conquered elsewhere. \nOverall, I feel much happier because I am actually more productive working from home, therefore I feel more useful at the end of the day and derive more pleasure from work. I also feel my stress levels, due to commuting and rushing around all the time, have gone down I have more time to focus on my passions and to exercise. \nThis is the major shift for me from being focused in having stability and following my passions being a luxury I now have time and space for both and I'd love to keep it that way.",
  "I have learned:\nHow important local communities are, how much people want to connect with their local communities when they are not taken up with long working hours, commuting, shopping etc\n How resilient local food shops are\nHow wonderful it is not to have so much traffic on the road and so many planes in the sky, I have really appreciated the peace.\nHow the inequalities in our society have been starkly shown in the pandemic- it has really brought home how having to live in a high rise inner city home with a family is so unfair compared to living a home with a garden or even more indoor space.\nHow totally dependent we are on the NHS and other key services and that they are not properly valued/treated in our society.\nI have also learnt how dependent we are as a nation on global trade.",
  "I have learned that communities come together to support one another in times of need. The community feeling was overwhelming at the start. \nI learned how I had full faith in my government going into this crisis even though I could see decisions we being made too late (lockdown) but quickly as our prime minister fell unwell and we saw different politicians everyday and then the ‚ÄòCummings‚Äô ordeal I quickly lost that faith in my government. Watching the advisers tell us how how infections are very real and politicians releasing our country so quickly. Mixed messages don‚Äôt fill you with confidence. \nI learned although my husband is self employed and we lost money for weeks and weeks we could pull together as a family unit and we shared amazing memories. Baking, playing games, exercising.",
  "I have learned that Britain was drastically under prepared and slow to react to a pandemic. I have learned that the care system is not something I want any of my family to enter into. I have learned that a small proportion of people are unwilling to behave in the interests of the many, but that the many are generally concerned with other's welfare. I have learned that lots of people think clapping is a sufficient substitute for a decent living wage. I have learned that most of my friends and family's working lives are perfectly possible to adapt to, and thrive while working from home. I have not changed my mind about anything- I still think this is a massively unfair society, but I have been very heartened at the general response from the population to protect the vulnerable.",
  "It has emphasised that people working in 'menial', usually low paid jobs - healthcare workers, dustmen, shop assistants, public transport - are needed much more than top executives.\nIt has emphasised that years of austerity have created a massive void in public services - especially heathcare.\nIt has emphasised that the Government can find money when it is needed - although it has been needed for a long time.\nI have learned that I don't need to shop so often and waste less food\nI have learned that I can live with Tesco delivering to me rather than doing my own shopping\nI have learned that there are two sets of rules - one for the working class and one for the elites\nI have learned that we are governed by liars who do not care about the people of this country",
  "I've learnt how most of our society adapt to change really quickly. I run a large general merch & food retail store for a well known company. \nMy team have been amazing and we've supported each other through this.\nHowever my real concern is the general public- at the start of the pandemic we had customers who did not and still not respecting/understanding social distancing. Now as some return to work they have become 'experts' trying to tell us our role in social distancing when we have been doing it the whole of lock down. I'm scared that this will then cause another outbreak - some people still say to me ' it's a load of rubbish this Corona' and I do believe this is because someone they care about has not been affected or choosing to be ignorant.",
  "My son has been home educated for a year before lock down and the general attitude was that it was an unusual even strange thing to do. My son has thrived on it and we are glad we made the choice. When kids go back I would like attitudes to be more open to the idea of home schooling and flexi schooling for those children who have benefited from the chance to be at home. This is not home schooling as we know it as we miss our social gatherings but for lots of kids it has taken away the pressure and bullying at school. I have friends who can‚Äôt afford to home school who are dreading sending their kids back. I think it would be fantastic if families had more options available to them if they feel learning at home is for them.",
  "I have LOVED the reduced pressure prompted by the simplicity of lockdown. \nI am shielding one of my children (heart valve replacement) so have not been going to shops, and due to limited deliveries/click and collect I've had to manage the meal planning better. Loss of my income (and zero support as my sole income is from my Airbnb property) has meant more baking and budgeting, growing my own food etc WHICH I'VE HAD THE TIME TO DO! I've used local resources, done swapping with neighbours and generally become more resourceful. All of this has been heavily reliant on internet connection. \nMore than anything else, I loved the absence of noise and pollution from land and air traffic which is sadly returning to normal",
  "We have reduced our food waste considerably - by buying more prudently - and our non-recycle-able bin invariable is not full on collection day. In contrast, the recycle-able bin is always full well before collection day.\nOur outgoings are much reduced but we‚Äôve still been able to purchase everything we need in one weekly shop or on-line.\nWe were fully supportive of government actions and restrictions - even if they subsequently proved wrong they always seemed sensible at the time - until Cummings showed such disdain for our efforts. Now, we are highly cynical about government actions and changes in restrictions; we will distance from others (except immediate family) as far as is possible and minimise travel.",
  "I've definitely learned more about the importance of digital connectivity in the absence of physical connectivity, and the need for a connection with nature to maintain mental health and clear my mind. I've been a remote worker from home for many years now, so was used to that, but it became clearer that I need to clarify the work-home life space, clear the laptop and work away from the family space at evenings, switch off the phone and engage more in the moment. I have been thinking I needed to wind down my photography business for a few years, but this crisis has speeded that thinking up and I am looking at new ways of working that will be covid-proof if we have future waves of virus outbreak.",
  "I always thought we were a sensible, fairly well organised country but I feel that we lurched into and through this Covid-19 crisis in a disorganised way. Some family members (in banking sector) were being told about potential work from home several weeks before lockdown so we stocked up well in advance of the panic buying. (I also live in a remote area & am always well stocked up in case of other emergencies). Other family members thought we were scare mongering & were emotionally shocked & caught out when lockdown happened. I also think it was irresposnible to let the Cheltenham races & Liverpool/Madrid football game go ahead when it was obvious what was heading our way across the continent.",
  "Working from home is far easier than I was ever told by a manager.\nParliament obviously doesn't need to sit in Westminster. MPs can stay more local to their constituencies, or Parliament can travel around, making it more accessible to people outside of London, and helping MPs from all over the country to see difficulties in poorer areas, or lack of infrastructure outside the south.\nSpending more time with family in my household has been really nice. Seeing family and friends physically has taken on new importance. This kind of travel would be greatly improved by a proper functioning public transport system.\nAir quality is so much better, and I feel healthier while outside in my community.",
  "Many things:\n-The majority of people are Initially trusting of Government\n-As a result the majority of people are inclined to follow directions, and accept official information.\n- clarity, information, consistency and unity: across disciplines, parties, professions etc is critical to maintenance of trust: ambiguity, hesitancy, over-reaction, secrecy etc erode trust.\n- We live in The Lake District: we have seen the priority for and benefits of drastic actions which cleared people and traffic from a National Park:noise, pollution, space, freedom to move around, balance in demand and resource etc.\n- We have also seen the critical effect on local communities and economies: we need a plan.",
  "A huge amount. \nI have learned not to trust the government at all, and that there is one rule for the rich and powerful and another for everyone else. I always believed it a bit, but it has been properly spelt out for us. I have no faith or trust in the government anymore and don't believe they have any consideration for the people in this country. \nI have learned that I can do my job at home, can be productive and am much happier when not in an open plan office and cummuting in traffic everyday. I have a better work life balance. \nMost of the things that I took for granted I don't miss, but I do miss being able to see my friends and family, and visit the countryside often.",
  "This has made it clearer that the social divides between rich and poor must change radically.\nWe have to use this time to re-establish a drive for equality of opportunity - understanding that it can never be fully achieved but is, none the less, a noble aim. Most importantly, this means breaking the hegemony of the privately educated - and, ideally, abolishing the private sector in education.. As a first step, senior positions in the civil service, membership of governing boards and eligibility for election to parliament should be denied to all those who have been privately educated. Maybe this should be brought into law slowly, over the next decade, but it has to happen.",
  "I would use different terms, more a question of experiences and a reinforcement of my view that humanity cannot go on like this. We must in future respect nature both in terms of reducing pollution and carbon emissions and in particular deter expansion of air travel as one of the worst pollutants. No more new air terminals. And if we are looking to introduce some rich/poor adjustments, use carbon credits as a form of air travel currency, and issue these to every individual over 18.\nIn terms of experiences, the biggest noticeable difference is that there is a greater community spirit and a greater sense of calm. The air is cleaner and you can hear more birdsong",
  "I‚Äôve grown a greater understanding of importance of local community, mental health support and the invaluable part local farms and shops play in a crisis. \nI‚Äôve learned more about where our food comes from and the knock on effect of failed harvests, for whatever reason, here and in other countries. \nI‚Äôve learned that in a crises which threatens the lives of millions, our government ARE able to take drastic steps and people ARE in the main, willing to listen to the scientists and do what is asked of them. Shame we can‚Äôt do the same for the climate and ecological crisis, which has already, and continues to each year, kill more people globally than Covid-19.",
  "Through this crisis as terrible has it has been for other people. I feel it helped mentally it allowed me to prioritise my needs as well as my families away from the working week. I have also been able to step away more from technology such as my phone and other devices in order to spend more time out doors eithier in my garden or through exercising. It has helped my first year of marriage grow in ways that I feel without this I wouldn't have had the opportunity. I feel now that I want to step back from more of my work commitments to allow to spend more time with my family enjoying simpler things. I am possibly looking at moving to a 4 day work week.",
  "I've learnt how much I depend for my identity on being active outside the home - giving workshops, seminars, performances, etc.I've learnt a great deal more about the detail of inequalities in our society, in terms of health, housing, education, and particularly life expectancy; the over-privilege of those in government has been responsible for their failure to manage the pandemic adequately.\nI've learnt how much my individual well-being (even though I've had a relatively easy time of it under lock-down) depends on how well the rest of society, particularly the poorest and most vulnerable groups, are faring. The news has often been unbreakably sad.",
  'I have always thought of my self as quite a self contained individual but have learnt that I am more dependent of external factors than I realised. I miss doing voluntary work, going out on day trips and the opportunity to go swimming and too the gym. We are lucky to have a big house and garden. My wife and I have enjoyed doing our own activities and have our own space in the day. We have even been "exercising " separately. \nWe get together for meals and watching things on the TV in the evenings. In this way we have maintained good relations. It must be terrible to be confined to a small space. \nThe garden and good weather have been a great blessing.',
  "The coronavirus has made me stop and think about all aspects of life.\nI strongly believe that the Country cannot and should not return to the status quo before the pandemic and this is the time to strive to build a improved society.\nLife /work balance was out of kilter and people lives were being put under acute pressure to achieve economic growth.\nThe success of a country should only be measured by the 'happiness' of the people.\nI understand that New Zealand have completely changed their social model, and that now they are recorded as being the happiest country in the world. What have they done and is this a model we should be looking to copy?",
  "I feel like I've un-learned the routine I was in and learned a new one ‚Äì a much slower pace of life. I have a 4 year old daughter and two step children and my partner and I work pretty much full time, so before the pandemic every day was manic and we felt under pressure constantly to earn and to do chores and to constantly entertain the children. Having my daughter at home for 10+ weeks has taught me that she doesn't need that much in order to be happy ‚Äì she's enjoyed really simple activities and especially anything outside. It's been a lovely change of pace and such an amazing change for all of us to be at home together for so long.",
  "What jobs are really of value in our society? Some of the lowest paid jobs, shop workers, delivery drivers, carers have kept the country running and should be valued more highly financially. It has been good to see that the NHS is appreciated instead of being constantly criticised. The media have behaved dreadfully by constantly criticising the government and trying to catch them out. Through their actions they have made the public feel very anxious. The government have worked tirelessly to try to do the best. Unprecedented times and not everything has been done well but only those with the power of hindsight may have done better!!!",
  "At the start of the crisis I thought that I should use the time to be as productive as possible but I learnt that I shouldn't be putting so much pressure on myself and that it is okay to just be me as I am now. \nThe crisis has made me reconsider what is important to me. I am in my fifth year of study at university. But I now feel like the most important thing to me is living a simple, environmentally friendly life with my partner with no more than we need. I would jump at the chance to move into a green job. It would feel incredibly satisfying to be contributing to the future health of the planet and human civilisation.",
  "That government can spend and intervene in serious ways when it is perceived necessary. This makes me think two things:\n- many of our fundamental social issues (e.g. rough sleepers) could be solved if we wanted\n- the climate crisis is going to require this amount of effort and more, we now need to approach it in the same way.\nI also think that it has shown how the UK government doesn't treat the public like adults. More seeing us as comms issue to be managed. When you have a stark comparison to Germany, or Taiwan, where the focus is far more on transparency and there is a lot more of trusting relationship.",
  "I have an even stronger respect for care workers and believe they should be paid more for their work. \nI have changed my mind about the pace that my children‚Äôs learning should be at. They have been learning as well at home with less pressure and speed that their current school curriculums had been teaching them. \nI have learned to slow down and we have enjoyed a less pressured life spending more quality time at home with each other \nI have learned that schools do far more than educate children and that the social and emotional care they are expected to provide is enormous and understaffed and underfunded.",
  "I feel that I've realised that Boris Johnson and his government care very little about the wellbeing of people in the UK and that they are quite prepared to see them as collateral damage if it furthers their political aims. At the start of the crisis, I was quite prepared to give them the benefit, believing that they were \"led by the science\" but over and over again, they have proved that this wasn't the case and that they old the British public in complete disdain. I am disgusted and fearful for the future because they are in charge. That saying, I was impressed by their furlough scheme.",
  "1) The duplicity of those who govern us. I feel I cannot trust any public statements by ministers, even (or especially) those that are backed by manipulated statistics. The hypocrisy that was revealed by the Cummings escape horrifies me, and I take little comfort from polling data that claim to reveal reduced support for those at the head of government.\n2) The essential thoughtlessness (and perhaps selfishness) of those who are pushing the limits on lockdown as it eases.\n3) The extraordinary generosity of strangers and neighbours who go to such great lengths to support others.",
  "I've learned that:\n-the community spirit in my street is much stronger than I'd realised\n-my husband and I can cope with and enjoy each other's unadulterated company as long as we have regular periods of private time \n-I can suppress the loss and depression I initially felt about not seeing my family (thanks mainly to Zoom)\n-I could live in the countryside, because the peace and quiet in the first stages of lockdown were amazing\nI've changed my mind about wishing my ancient parents were living in sheltered care. The treatment of old people in care homes has been deplorable.",
  "I have learned that many of the systems we live under are oppressive in some way to anyone who isn‚Äôt white ethnicity and wealthy. I have learned personally that earning 80% of my income without working has increased the quality of my life in a very big way despite an ongoing pandemic. It took the pandemic lockdown for everyday life to slow down to a pace that is comfortable for me. It seems the pace is currently creeping back up and I feel uneasy about returning to that version of normal because I realise now that I was working like a drone and not living a life.",
  "The important things in life have really stood out to me, this gave me a chance to reflect and slow down a little. \nWe don‚Äôt need holidays abroad to be happy but we need each other. \n As a key worker I have been going to work throughout this crisis and this normality has made it easier for me than others. Work is more important to me than I realised. I am using my car less and my bike more. I‚Äôm appreciating the green spaces so much more and going outside to exercise, and I am focused on supporting local businesses as much as possible as I don‚Äôt want to lose them.",
  "I've learned to use video conference for work & for social life. \nI'm self-employed and I've learned about the vulnerability of being my own boss. \nI've appreciated living in Brighton. Including close access (via bike) to the S Downs & the sea. I've learned how much I miss live music & going to the cinema. \nMost of my (grown up) children live in SW England & I've learned I miss them & video/call is a limited substitute for seeing them. \nI've learned that a government can be allowed to take great power in a crisis, but can also squander this permission.",
  "I have learned that things can change overnight and not to take things for granted and appreciate people and family.\nI wish I had saved more for emergencies as I had to go unpaid as I didn't qualify for furlough.\nCommunity spirit has greatly improved and gone back to what it was like years ago.\nWork is tricky as I can't work from home. I think people will look at working from home going forward and offices will close. There will be no differential between home and work life.\nPrices will increase as will tax.

  "I am quite left-wing as it is, but it has been re-affirmed to me that a well-run and properly funded state is essential to public health, and the public in general.\nI have learned that working life can be well-replicated virtually, so we should take the opportunity to encourage this, both for peoples' well being and for the environment.\nI have re-discovered the importance of social interaction. In recent years, I had not made much effort to engage with friends and family, but having the option taken away has made realise its importance.",
  "I've learned to appreciate how easy it used to be to just pop out to the shops for things we needed or to go abroad on holiday. I'll never take those for granted ever again. I've stayed in for over 10 weeks but now I dread the new queues and restrictions and I literally can't be bothered to go to the shops. I've shopped online for essentials - it's been cheaper and easier in most cases, though returns have been tricky with the very variable Post Office hours - so I'll most likely stick with online, at least in the short to mid term.",
  "I feel that prior to this I didn't give enough time to myself to relax and recharge. This has made me rethink my life balance. I also feel that by making small changes in the way we live, regular hand washing, covering our nose and mouth when coughing and sneezing and be more respectful can actually improve everyone's health in the future. In particular during the winter months where there are increaaed hospital admissions. Also, children have been able to spend more time with their families which I believe will increase stability.",
  "I have learned more about how to grow vegetables and how to use FaceTime. I have learned about British archealogical heritage from working my way through old BBC IPlayer programmes. My french has improved. I have learned to be patient through trying to support my husband with mental health problems exacerbated by lockdown. I have been told I would be good at coping in prison! So I have learned to be more stoical.\nI am in the process of changing my mind on green issues, to recognise that things (and me) need to change more quickly.",
  "Key workers who keep the country going should be better paid and better respoected. Not just doctors, teachers etc but all essetial workers like shop assistants, nurses and carers, transport staff, refuse collectors, delivery drivers, postal workers and many more. Some of these jobs would possibly have not been considered so worthwhile as others, and are definitely not as well paid, but we have all relied on them over the last few months, as we always do, but now I think more people realise how essential they are to every day life.",
  "I have lost confidence in the Governement. I did not vote for them but even so they have behaved appallingly - much worse than i imagined they would in a crisis. I am now very much in favour of crossparty joint committees in the event of national emergencies to prevent a single political agenda putting the nation at risk. And if anything Iam even more in favour of international cooperation and the uk being further integrated into the European Union as I believe more security and safety lies in being partners in the future.",
  "Society is quite split. A lot of people are out there for themselves, some first without considering others, some just first and then possibly considering others. This has been seen in stockpiling, breaking of lockdown rules, attitudes to volunteering, considering other environmental issues (especially single use plastics, fly tipping, dog fouling) one rule for me and another for everyone else (Cummings etc). Others have been very much putting people first in the care / medical sector and many elements of volunteering.",
  "The community in which I live has stepped up and dealt with all the practical and spiritual issues raised on a daily basis.Those shielding have had foodstuffs and medication delivered.\nThe local authority were a little slow out of the blocks but came to work alongside our very strong local charity after 3 weeks and now all the needs of approx 2500 vulnerable people are dealt with in a very co-ordinated way.\nI feel that people will in future be kinder and consider others in the same way as they consider themselves.",
  "We‚Äôre really lucky to have the family and friends we have, and the house and garden we have... and we live in a beautiful part of the country.\nThere are many people who want to do what they want to do, regardless of what what they should do. \nMany people care, some people do not care and cannot see beyond their own narrow perspective.\nLeadership is so important at times like these and unfortunately many people in power are grossly incompetent, personal agendas and egos should be put aside at times like these.",
  "I'm not sure. I already held the NHS in very high regard before the crisis, and I'm even more respectful of what frontline workers go through each day to keep us all healthy. \nI think the crisis has made it even clearer how crucial good leadership is during times of emergency, in that we haven't had much strong leadership from this current government. Comparing its actions with those of governments elsewhere in the world (eg New Zealand) has shown what could be a good way forward for future governments.",
  "Yep. I'm now much more distrustful of mainstream media reportage and of politicians. This thing is not the plague they can be forgiven for having thought it might be, but, given very much better data, they are unable to change course. Why? What's the problem with saying it looked at first like a very serious disaster in the making, but it now turns out quite clearly that it was not? I worry, stupidly perhaps, that the forces of evil, oh dear, that word, will use this to enslave their peoples.",
  "I have learned that the material things don't actually matter. Also that I can happily work from home and not need to travel into an office.\nI have also learned that the majority of people are kind and want to do the right thing but that there are and will always be a large number of people that just don't care or are ignorant and believe that the rules do not apply to them. \nI also think that people need to seriously think about the planet and the climate and stop just focusing on human greed.",
  "I have learned that I don't trust the government. I feel that we are not told the truth. I have also learned that in a crisis, command and control is adopted. This maybe necessary in the immediate but local devolution of power and action should have been created. It is still not apparent how people are part of the solution. It feels utterly disempowering and I don't believe will help is to build a healthy society moving forward. I have a deep sense of foreboding about it.",
  "I'm a teacher and have really missed being in the classroom and all the every day interactions with students that you just don't/can't get online. This has also made me question the validity and value of our current public exam system - do we really want to go back to the same regime, especially in primary school?\nI have recently started to feel a sense of isolation, missing my friends and family, and have also become more disillusioned with the government and media.",
  "That I have got to know my neighbours better. That some people will never follow advice. That I can do certain aspects of my work online, which I didn't before. That there is a generosity of spirit generally at first but in time this wanes for some. That being unable to physically see family and friends is not good for the soul. But that technology can ease the pain of separation for me. That I need routine and activities to keep my mood up and stay motivated.",
  "This crisis has confirmed to me that the office is still an important place for colleagues to work together. I have always advocated flexible working, liking having the option to WFH one or two days per week, however I bristle at the suggestion that this is the end of the office. \nTeamwork, collaboration, productivity, socially - all of these things are enhanced be people working in close proximity to each other for at least part of their working week.",
  "How much I value the freedom of being able to travel/visit places/facilities with my friends and family. I have hated being restricted to my home - albeit we live in a nice house in a nice area. \nI value my child‚Äôs schooling for her wellbeing and education. Children should be having fun with their peers, school is much more than just education for them - there are their special carefree days. I am sad my child will have missed out on 5 months of this",
  "I have enjoyed the slower pace of family life. I am grateful we have a garden and for the fantastic weather over the period as a whole. My world has become very small... But that hasn't been a bad thing.\nHowever, I am a headteacher of a primary school and the stress of managing the last 14 weeks has taken its toll. I don't feel that people in my job have the understanding of the public in terms of the enormous pressure we have been under throughout.",
  "I think this crisis has changed my outlook on what normal life should be like. I have valued the relationship I have with my partner more and have spoken more honestly about how I'm feeling day to day. I miss seeing my family and friends, but I actually became used to staying in and staying safe, which is a contrast to my usually busy lifestyle. Most people are able to work from home, alleviating much of the pollution from cars and planes.",
  "Yes, the relative weight I put on various aspects of my life and how I spend my time. I have enjoyed exercising more, reading more, talking to friends and family more. I have enjoyed the simplicity of life that the lockdown has brought to me although I understand that for others it has made life more comfortable. I have enjoyed seeing improvements in the environment - no takeaway litter everywhere, bluer skies, cleaner air etc etc",
  "I have learned we were living too fast. Consumerism was priority. And even in my life I shopped at charity shops for clothes, low price supermarkets etc my shopping habits have and will change. Supporting local shops as much as I can. Shopping once a week and buying what we need. We are growing our own vegetables, playing board games with the children, being mindful in most areas because we have the time to stop and think.",
  "I have learnt that the system cannot be relied to support everyone nd there are lots of people that have received no support whatsoever. I have also learnt that the government cannot be relied upon to look after our interests and we need to be able to do this for ourselves. I have also learnt that many people are happy to sit and home and take furlough pay for as long as they possibly can, while other's of us have to work.",
  "The importance of outdoor space, something I took for granted. Access to good broadband, without this three of us in the household couldn't work from home at the same time. These are not nice to have they are essential. How we don't need to be so reliant on cars, not used mine for weeks. That living a quieter life is good, not rushing from on thing to the next, taking time to listen to the Bird song and sit in the garden.",
  "I learned that Government is not there to look after people. I learned that we are divided by politics- but actually came together when it mattered. Now we are pulled apart by politicians yet again- all the cracks are emerging. My biggest fear is that we will want to quickly get back to how things were before- even though it is exactly why we are in this mess. If we don't change things now- we never will. That scares me.",
  "I have learnt the importance of friendships and relationships. I think I took for granted how many people I interact with on a daily basis and it's really affected me to be so isolated. I have a new empathy for people living alone, in small accommodation and with a lack of a social or work life. I hope we can do more to tackle loneliness moving forward and also make better use of existing community hubs and green spaces.",
  "Yes, identity, society and sense of community is stronger in the UK than we might have been led to believe in recent years. As a country we are far more capable of achieving good things than we realise. While we need to work with other countries we have also become too dependent and need to build our resilience and self sufficiency in key areas. We have an amazing opportunity to turn this crisis into something positive.",
  "I‚Äôve learned that I am more social of a person than I ever thought I was. Being put in a position to have to stay home has really made me miss the freedom of choices I‚Äôve taken for granted. \nI‚Äôve also learned that everybody has an opinion and unfortunately some people can only comprehend exactly what they hear from the media and then there‚Äôs some of us who take bits of info from everywhere to form an educated decision.",
  "I feel I have learned how susceptible we are as a society, in different ways across each sector, class, gender and ethnicity. People have been affected in very different ways and have reacted in very different ways too. It has brought home to me how reliant I am on a fragile economy. I have changed my mind about how much I want to be involved in my local community and the decisions and policies that affect us all.",
  "I have realized how fragile our lives are, how vulnerable we are. I am disappointed to see how poor we are at pulling together in our professional roles and pleased to see how well we can pull together as a species on a local level. I am frustrated by moaners! WE're in danger of getting this so wrong and we need to change in profound ways. A wonderful surprise to see how good this has been for the planet.",
  "I have learned that there are many selfish people who have no consideration for others. I base this on the early panic buying by some which left shelves empty for others. Now that lockdown is starting to be relaxed a little people are flocking to beaches and taking part in protest marches having no consideration for social distancing. This is a smack in the face for all NHS staff who have given so much to us",
  "1. Less confidence in our government given their terrible handling of the pandemic.\n2. Amazing to see how communities have come together to support each other.\n3. Also amazing to see how services have adapted to digital delivery (especially mental health services - the field I work in).\n4. Disappointment in the number of ppl in east London who don't physically distance, which deters me from going out.",
  "I was struck how at the start of the lockdown it was so incredibly peaceful. No cars, lorries planes. Real peace. Birds singing clearly. On one hand it was unnerving and strange but on the other it was enjoyable. I felt calmer, less stressed. I enjoyed the trafficless streets. No pollution. I dread the return of masses of traffic and fumes. We must encourage more use of walking, bikes and public transport.",
  "1. That we set ourselves up for failure with years of underfunding the nhs.\n2. That we dont need to travel as much and can reduce emissions hugely if we want to\n3. That tackling obesity is key as is was a key factor in covid deaths \n4. That we can come together in a global effort to tackle a global issue. We need to learn from this experience in order to come together as a globe to tackle climate change.",
  "Lots but mostly insights that have been confirmed - such as the beauty of interconnectedness with all things natural and human-made, our utter interdependence on each other at the levels of neighbourhood, town, city, country, continent, globe. Nature is ever giving and now she's given us what feels like a final warning. The climate, the ecosystem, all, all is connected and we must stop attacking it all.",
  "How lucky I am to have a loving family, to be able to run/walk/cycle around London. The importance of being able to get into the countryside. Huge value in local community, so much better without airplane noise and quieter roads.\nOnline meetings and learning are not a substitution for personal interaction.\nOnline art/theatre and museums not of value to me. You cannot work and educate at the same time.",
  "We should all be taught and mad aware more of our own and others Mental health. This time has really shown how our society pre crisis was not healthy for our collective wellbeing.\nSociety and neighborhood is a simple yet effect support system. Since lockdown I have seen such beautiful acts of kindness and care to each other and we need more of this. Less focus on individual and more on the collective.",
  "Life as we knew it was overrated. Being in lockdown has emphasized a need to pull together and look out for each other. It was heart warming to hear the first clap for carers, see people have friendly chats over garden fences or help with shopping. Not having had to commute has reinvigorated a desire to cook and eat healthy and having gained the time usually spent on commuting allowed for more me time",
  "It has highlighted the inequalities for working people and ethnic minority people.\nAlso has shown how workers rights have been eroded and the devastating double impact on health and income this has had during the corona crisis. that there is little support to prevent people losing everything and going hungry and homeless. That the rich institutions such as banks are distributing wealth to the wealthy",
  "I have learned the importance of touch - of being able to hug those we care about.\nI have been reminded of the importance of green spaces and how we should be fighting to protect them and our planet as much as we are fighting coronavirus. I have seen how many of us could work from home more if we and our employers are flexible and committed and the positive impact this can have on our environment.",
  "We live in the centre of a big city. The change in lack of cars has been astounding and great - the smells have gone, the noises have gone, the air feels fresher, children are playing in the street again. I have slept well for what feels like the first time in 5 years (as long as I have lived here). I used to think cars were essential to the functioning of the city- now I don‚Äôt believe they are.",
  "Yes many things. I thought I would enjoy working from home but its difficult and I miss work. I thought I would struggle not going out of the house as much socially but this has actually been okay. The Government seemed to be an okay job managing this initially, at least what they were portraying, but I have definitely changed my mind on this and feel that this has not been well managed at all.",
  "Learned how much quietness has helped provide a more relaxed feel to everyday living and how natural noise especially birdsong helps with that. Appreciated the opportunity to see how important co-operation is - nationally, locally, socially and also as a family unit - and hope that this is something that is appreciated and remains as a 'national learning' opportunity as a result of the crisis.",
  "Working from home is doable but it doesn‚Äôt replace interactions face to face. Zoom burnout is real. Cyber communication is still under developed and needs investment to ensure we can read body language and facial cues easily. Less work travel has created quieter stress free roads, and more time with the kids at the beginning and end of the day, which has been invaluable to work life balance.",
  "How fragile the entire global economy is, yet the govt had the ability to pay the country's wages for a significant period of time. This makes one wonder if such a thing as universal basic income, as posited by Rutger Bregman in 'Utopia for Realists', might actually be possible. We have also had our eyes opened to which jobs matter most to us (and how Dickensian Universal Credit really is).",
  "I have learned how little the government has got a handle on this virus. Day by day they look worse and worse, and the statistics are getting higher.\nOnce again, London and the south east has been used as the norm for planning. Everyone else is not considered. Apparently the situation is getting better, but that is not relevant here as it hasn‚Äôt reached us yet! \nI no longer want to travel",
  "What a dichotomy our society is. Generous & caring as the community help groups sprung up on Facebook and people started to support their neighbours. Self centred & ill disciplined when people broke lockdown and flocked to beaches. \nIt‚Äôs also been very apparent our police are massively under resourced, under staffed and their powers limited and woolly, they were put in a terrible situation.",
  "A lot has changed.\nAnd the experience has been a double edged sword.\nEnjoyed community spirit and a more relaxed day to day life. Social distancing has meant having to do things more slowly.\nBut lots of stress and worry about future of work. My funding has been delayed.\nDaughter missed GCSEs and this has been really difficult and stressful.\nEnjoyed less traffic on roads no aeroplanes in sky.",
  "The value of my oldest friends, that people can show incredible bravery and kindness, that children need to be in school and with their friends but that I don‚Äôt agree with how the U.K. curriculum is taught having had to home school. That there are a lot of angry people in the U.K. who seem to never be happy with any decisions but on the flip side that democracy is more important than ever.",
  "I value an independent press even more than ever. I value all the workers and volunteers who have kept us going throughout this and it's been encouraging to see communities pulling together. On the other hand it has been intensely depressing to see the amount of lying and obfuscation going on in public life. Trust is so fundamentally important at all times but especially during a pandemic.",
  "That society was on the wrong track and we needed this time out to re-evaluate what is important. We desperately need a better work life balance, more time to do things we enjoy. More time to relax, see family and appreciate nature. We can't carry on working ourselves to death with no other purpose in life. I don't want to go back to that as it has affected my physical and mental health.",
  "The environmental benefits of restricting unnecessary transport, especially the lower pollution from less urban congestion and air traffic. \nThe fragile state of our NHS which isn't equipped (literally) to deal with a pandemic after a decade of Government neglect. \nThe full horrifying extent of the damage caused by the privileged elite prioritising individual wealth over a nation's health.",
  "That government can work more efficiently. That much unnecessary practice in the NHS and Social Care has hamstrung efficiencies and working practices. That education and learning should be reformed for the 21st century and that many, many people can work at home flexibly without impact on their work and many offices can be much smaller and used for gathering rather than for desk based work.",
  "I have learned that the Government does not have contingencies for disasters on a national scale. I think it is very frightening that something which could so easily have been controlled, was able to take over the entire country. Our emergency services were in a very poor condition; close to breaking point, before this even happened. The PPE matter has been a complete and utter shambles.",
  "Both my wife and I have relished the slower pace of life as well as the reduction in both noise and air pollution. We have learnt that we enjoy our own company and do not need much socialisation. We always thought we would retire to an urban area but we are increasingly thinking about retiring to a rural area in order to preserve the lifestyle we have become accustomed to in recent months.",
  "That the way we were working before the crisis was unhealthy. As a mother a more flexible working working pattern has made a huge difference to my, and my children's well being.\nAlso, I have learnt that the divisions in society have got not better! If anything it has highlighted precarious position the most vulnerable in society. Additionally it appears to me that they are almost unheard.",
  "I have realised I value going out to work more than I thought, but I have also realised I never want to work full time in an office again. A happy medium between life now and life as it was seems to be the answer similarly with social life, I have realised I was too busy previously, but I also really miss it now - working 5 days a week seems incompatible to getting the mix of life right",
  "Family is everything, but we all lived in our bubbles rushing about. But through this pandemic life has slowed down and we all realise now too that community is so very important. We all have a duty of care for others, in times of crisis we need to, and many have, stepped up to be counted. I salute the nhs, brave across the board and are now properly valued. They should be better paid.",
  "I have become much more interested in politics and have no confidence in the government. I feel the public has been constantly lied to , figures have been manipulated etc for political reasons. \n I feel frustrated and sometimes quite frightened by this wholly inadequate lack of faith in leadership of this country .For the first time in my life I wish I didn‚Äôt live in England!",
  "Need funding for cycling lanes and safe routes now, and more extreme measures in Birmingham such as charging zones and shortened hours for vehicles. This city was choking before lockdown and I am terrified as a non-driver about going back to air pollution, 24 hours a day traffic noise pollution, people taking cars for short journeys and the lack of cycling lanes and safe routes.",
  "I am a nurse and the pandemic has let me see the best of healthcare and destroy the artificial barriers that organisations, providers, commissioners makes and let us all just be healthcare. The things we can do and achieve when we work together as one are huge and nobody worries about performance, overspend, competitors and just worries about carin for people and each other.",
  "The main thing for me is the realisation that our lives are usually under too much time pressure and so we arent really as 'in control' of our own actions as we think we are, due to the multitiude of outside influences that normally drive our behaviour, becoming ever increasing.",
  "The Government isn't as reliable in times of national crisis as i thought they would be. \nI would've thought they'd spend some time making sure the message is clear throughout, having their entire party understand what they are aiming for, and not assuming that the British Public would give up with the lockdown if it started too soon, which i think has cost lives",
  "Resilience is society. There is no such thing as an individual there is only society. Leadership needs to be negotiated open and transparent not authoritative and fool hardy.\nLife without meeting people is boring and only a temporary solution.\nWe need to pay some people a lot more and some people a lot less. \nWe need a job guarantee and a green Revolution.",
  "I have learned just how little you actually need to leave the house. My wife and I are now very adept at on line shopping. Although companies like Amazon are annoying by not paying their taxes, they do provide an excellent service. We actually couldn‚Äôt get an on line supermarket delivery so had to go once a week to shop. However no queues at the supermarket.",
  "I have learned a little about myself, how I've coped with the crisis,my strengths and weakness.\nIt has caused me to reflect on the pace of my life and to stop and stare more and appreciate my surroundings\nIt has forced me to interact more positively with technology.\nIt has made me distrust governments and politicians even more than I did before the crisis.",
  "It has reinforced my view regarding the importance of community. In our village people have organised themselves to call people, offer to go shopping, share garden produce etc,\nYoung and old have made an effort to create community activities and virtual events. \nI have learned that our village is a better place for having fewer vehicles going through it.",
  "I‚Äôve learned that we, as a society, can achieve a lot, very quickly, when the pressure is on, e.g. people can indeed work from home, GPs can contact and advise remotely, hospital wards can be rearranged and opened, technology embraced, new hospitals built in weeks. Amazing! I‚Äôve loved this ‚Äòcan do‚Äô approach which seems to have been out of reach for so long.",
  "The value of informal social interactions, e.g. chance meetings with friends, a conversation with a shop worker, or a colleague at the vending machine. \nAlso my reliance on travel and international movement, both professionally and personally. But with lockdown, how 2 miles and 200 miles and 2000 miles distance from somebody can feel like the same thing.",
  "That society is built upon perceived success, which is related to money and possessions. In this time those things have become less important and people have seen the real value in family, friendship and community. There‚Äôs aren‚Äôt related to money and therefore made people reflect on what our focus should be on.",
  "Racial justice is much more of a significant issue than i previously thought. Boris Johnson and his government is even less competent than i thought 6 months ago. Piers Morgan and Alister Campbell are the real heros of trying to hold the government to account. Twitter is great, i had hardly used it 4 months ago.",
  "I‚Äôve realised that office based work isn‚Äôt as important as I thought it was but that actually being able to see other people in the flesh is. I‚Äôve experienced more time with my kids than for years. I‚Äôve enjoyed being limited to my local area and not travelling by car or public transport.",
  "Importance of washing hands after passing through places with many people, not just regarding covid but normal coughs and colds which can survive on these doors/banisters etc. This is pertinent to me as i have a form of immune deficiency which makes me prone to chest infections",
  "How fragile the nation is to a serious infections disease; and how there is no or little proper planning for such catastrophic but very unlikely events; and also that too many decisions are taken by authorities which are more for the benifit of the old (like me) than the young.",
  "Lots of things!\n- Value of public services and infrastructure\n- UK exceptionalism is mistaken (but I think I knew this before)\n- Communities do still exist, and people do seem to put effort into supporting each other \n- I really like life (and work) under lockdown",
  "The crucial importance of the natural world in people‚Äôs lives\nThe increased difficulties facing 18-25s\nThe importance of local\nIncreasing awareness of the significance of diversity \nThe power of the media \nHow each individual can contribute to the general good",
  "Turns out a term time holiday wouldn't be the catastrophe for my children's education that teachers have previously tried to have me believe, seeing as they're perfectly content for my children to receive no education for 6 months+",
  "Have learned:\n- how much I need to see, talk to and hug other people\n- how little money I can live on by not going to shops, cafes etc\n- how Politicians will lie through their  teeth, even in a time of national crisis",
  "I have learned to be more tolerant and patient. More aware of other people and how different/same we all are. In that we all need the same basic necessities, a home, food, transport, social engagement and family and friends.",
  "The positive impact on mental wellbeing of a thirty-minute walk before starting work\nThe critical importance of green spaces in cities and towns There is no need for anywhere near as much private vehicle use within cities",
  "I have found that the young people I know are much more dependent on the physical presence of their friends than they thought. I live alone, and thought I would miss my own friends and social life far more than I have.",
  "The ability for systems change. With the full weight of government and public opinion behind an issue, systems can be changed, at least temporarily. It remains to be seen whether this can be done in non-crisis times.",
  "Learned more about value of trust, use of statistics.\nI thought online shopping would enable me to reduce risks but this was not available for weeks.\nRealise the changes in young children from lack of socialization.",
  "To place a greater value on people and their efforts.\n To mistrust the media.\n To realise that all countries are in it for themselves only, as is shown by China, and the other EU countries treatment of the Italians.",
  "We can change the way we live and work. We can put our environment first. We can work together. We can work less and have a better work life balance. Corruption and lies in government must always be challenged.",
  "How clean the air has become since lockdown.\nSome people will not follow advice.\nNeed to have your own outdoor space.\n Need to have your family nearby.\nHow handy my smartphone and tablet are to keep in touch.",
  "There are alot of good people out there who are willing to help, volunteer, talk to you etc. People are more resilient than I thought. The NHS & key workers are worth more than they are paid.",
  "Hopefully this will be covered by the following questions but we have learned the benefits of communication through on-line video tools such as Skype, teams and Zoom.",
  "Learned which skills are truly valuable to society (key workers). \nLearned how to do more with less: don't need to buy new clothes all the time, planning food more.",
  "That we are forced to live life at a fast pace. Through peer pressure, through fear of missing out, to avoid facing up to those hard to deal with situations.",
  "How vulnerable our economy is. How important our environment is. How difficult it will be to redcue our carbon emissions. How much traffic there is normally",
  "Life is uncertain, the world is in crisis, and plans that I had made for the future are being revisited. I prefer not to commute, but I also miss the office!",
  "The majority of people in this country are overweight and unfit , we rely on the NHS to put us right not for us to at least attempt to keep ourselves health",
  "Learnt about how fragile our democracy is but also how strong our local communities are. Challenge is how do you balance and foster both going forward",
  "I have learned how integrated the world is and in particular how reliant we are on China and therefore how susceptible we are to such unknown viruses.",
  "I think we have all had to look at living in a more local way - what's on our doorstep, being less consumer driven, learning who our neighbours are.",
  "Yes. How much change can happen on a global and national scale in a short period of time. \n Hopefully a time that will change people for the better.",
  "I've become aware that i am quite self sufficient and don't need to be constantly travelling or seeking outside entertainment in order to be happy.",
  "I have learnt that humans can‚Äôt control all natural incidents. \nChanged my opinion of my employer,they have been responsive and supportive to staff",
  "(1) The population as a whole are overwhelmingly kind and caring.\n(2) The population as a whole feel and show gratitude for kindness shown to them.",
  "Our previous way of life was unsustainable. We were working too many hours, prioritising the wrong things and running ourselves into the ground.",
  "Not to trust our government\n That I don't need to spend money to be happy\nThat my family is the most important thing\n That maybe I should emigrate?",
  "There are more people disregarding advice than I ever would have imagined possible. I'm amazed by the stupidity of some of the people in Britain.",
  "Its definitely the small stuff that is important in life ... like meeting friends for a catch up over a coffee and having meals out with family!",
